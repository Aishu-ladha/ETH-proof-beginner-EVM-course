# Project: Create a Token

The repository contains my assignment for the MetaCrafters course. Each assignment is organized in its own folder, with the necessary code files and any additional resources.

## Description

we will create a contract together to fulfill the following requirements:

contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
We will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the address by that amount.
contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the address.
Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of account is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

## Getting Started

To get started with the assignments, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/metacrafters-assignments.git.
Navigate to the specific assignment folder: cd assignmentX (replace X with the assignment number).
Read the assignment description and requirements in the README file within each assignment folder.
Complete the assignment by writing the necessary code and making any required changes.
Test your code and ensure it meets the assignment requirements.
Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
